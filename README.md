Codebase for Inducing Causal Structure for Interpretable Neural Networks

## Release Notes
* **12/01/2021**: Code and [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00826) are initially released. Stay tuned for complete implementation for all case studies.

## Installation
*****
First clone the directory. Then run the following command to initialize the submodules:

```bash
git submodule init; git submodule update
```

Each time pulling from the repository, should do it for both the main repository and the submodules. You can also do it via our script:

```bash
bash pull.sh
```

## Usage
*****
You will find examples where we implement interchange intervention training (IIT) under `./examples` folder.
